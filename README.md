## Introduction

Brain Tumor Detection using CNN and scikit-learn is a project that aims to automatically detect brain tumors in MRI images. It utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and scikit-learn, a powerful Python library for machine learning, to perform the classification task.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Saran73/Brain-tumor-detection-using-CNN-and-SCIKIT.git
   cd Brain-tumor-detection-using-CNN-and-SCIKIT
Install the required dependencies using pip:

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage
Place your brain MRI images in the data directory.

(Optional) Preprocess the images using the provided functionalities for re-arranging image size, distortion, and reshaping. You can find these functionalities in the preprocessing.py file.

Train the CNN model using the preprocessed data:

bash

python train.py
Evaluate the model and generate predictions:

bash

python evaluate.py
Functionalities
This project provides the following functionalities:

Re-arranging Image Size: Use the resize_image() function in preprocessing.py to resize the images to a specific size.

Distortion: The apply_distortion() function in preprocessing.py can be used to apply image distortion techniques to augment the dataset.

Reshaping: The reshape_image() function in preprocessing.py reshapes the images to the desired dimensions.

Feel free to modify and extend these functionalities to suit your project's specific requirements.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project can be found at [link-to-your-dataset] (if publicly available). If the dataset is not publicly available, please specify how to obtain it or provide alternative instructions.

Model Architecture
The CNN model architecture used in this project is defined in the model.py file. You can customize the model architecture by modifying this file.

Results
Include details of the model's performance and evaluation metrics here. For example, you can add accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score values on the test dataset.

Contributing
Contributions are welcome! If you find any issues or want to add new features, feel free to open a pull request. Please ensure to follow the standard coding guidelines and provide appropriate documentation for your changes.
